React Stopwatch
Overview
This is a simple React-based stopwatch application built with functional components and hooks. It allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer that displays time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds (MM:SS:MS). The app is styled with vanilla CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.
Features

Start/Stop Timer: Toggle the stopwatch with a single button that switches between "Start" and "Stop."
Reset Timer: Reset the timer to 00:00:00.
Time Display: Displays elapsed time in MM:SS:MS format, updating every 10ms for smooth millisecond tracking.
Responsive Design: Centered layout with vanilla CSS, including hover effects and conditional button styling (green for start, red for stop).

Technologies Used

React: JavaScript library for building the user interface, using hooks (useState, useRef, useEffect).
Vanilla CSS: Custom styles defined in App.css for layout, typography, and button design.
JavaScript (ES6+): For logic, including timer management and time formatting.

Installation

Clone the Repository (if hosted on Git):
git clone <repository-url>

Alternatively, create a new React project:
npx create-react-app stopwatch
cd stopwatch


Replace Files:

Replace src/App.js with the provided App.js code.
Replace or create src/App.css with the corresponding CSS styles.


Install Dependencies:
npm install


Start the Development Server:
npm start

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.


Usage

Start the Timer: Click the "Start" button to begin timing.
Stop the Timer: Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
Reset the Timer: Click the "Reset" button to set the timer back to 00:00:00. The reset button is disabled when the time is zero.
The timer updates every 10ms, displaying the elapsed time in MM:SS:MS format.

Project Structure

src/App.js: Main application file containing the Stopwatch component and App component.
src/App.css: CSS file with styles for the stopwatch, including layout, typography, and button designs.
public/index.html: Default HTML template (unchanged from Create React App).

Notes

useRef Hook: The useRef hook is used to manage the timer interval ID, ensuring it persists across renders and can be cleared when stopping or resetting the timer.
useEffect Cleanup: The useEffect hook includes cleanup to prevent memory leaks by clearing the interval when the component unmounts or the timer stops.
Styling: The app uses vanilla CSS for a clean, responsive design with hover effects and conditional button colors.
Performance: The timer updates every 10ms for smooth millisecond display, balanced with efficient state management.

Future Improvements

Add lap/split time functionality to record intermediate times.
Persist timer state using localStorage for continuity across page reloads.
Implement keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Space to start/stop, R to reset).
Add animations for button clicks or time updates to enhance UX.
